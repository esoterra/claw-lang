## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Claw Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct][CoC]. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to me@esoterra.dev.

## Getting Started Contributing

The best way to start contributing is to become a user.

As a user, you can then help by

1. Noticing problems with Claw or its docs and [filing issues][issues]
    * Please check if they've already been filed first!!
    * Focus on clear bugs, well-defined problems, obvious gaps, etc. here.
2. Participating in and starting [discussions] about potential new features
    * Let's keep open ended and [bikeshed]-style conversations here!

Once you're familiar with the project and its code, it's a good time to look for code contributions to make.

Try to find an issue with maintainer (@esoterra) approval (ideally a [good first issue]) and try to implement it.

When you're ready, submit a Pull Request or Draft Pull Request and we'll take a look at it!
